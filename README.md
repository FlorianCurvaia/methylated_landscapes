# methylated_landscapes
This repository contains my python and R code to analyse genotype-phenotype landscape which contain methylated DNA sequences.

For now, the files here are not in their final version, as they need to be properly commented. Most of them are almost fully commented, but I still need to adapt the comments and finsish to comment them.
